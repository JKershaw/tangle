# Progress

*A living log against [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Newest entry first. The scoreboard holds the current numbers; the frontier table holds where each known issue stands.*

## Scoreboard

Micro-evals (`scripts/eval.mjs visits`): pass rate over the cases in `evals/visits.json`.

| date | commit | prompt · grammar | 0.6B | 1.7B | 4B | 8B |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| recorded outputs (the failures we collected, under the prompts of their day) | — | pocket-2 to pocket-9 | 7/24 across all models | | | |
| 2026-09-17 | 9f8bc21 | pocket-9 · per-action-6 | **8/24** | running | queued | queued |

Benchmark (`scripts/eval.mjs runs`): per seed, `resolved · facts/supported · cost`. Tangle versus flat.

| date | commit | model | mode | seeds resolved | facts | supported | calls | lookups |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — | not yet run | | | | |

## Frontier

| issue | fixture | micro-eval cases | benchmark delta | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| root frozen by honest blocks | — | (whole-run only) | pending first matrix | open, John's call on the revisit policy |
| one answer found forty times | — | `no-self-repeat-1.7b` | pending first matrix | open, John's call on refusing repeats |
| does not resolve when the excerpts already answer | — | `resolve-when-supported-*` ×3, `synthesis-*` ×2 | — | 0.6B 0/5 |
| does not read a section by name | — | `section-by-name-*` ×4 | — | 0.6B 0/4; 8B did it in the run the case came from |
| cannot pick a section from an enum | — | `section-pick-*` ×3 | — | 0.6B 0/3, 1.7B 3/3 in the recorded run |
| correct but unsupported findings | `unsupported finding` ×2 | `grounded-8b-dead-sea` | pending (supported-facts column) | flagged only |
| memory over evidence | `unsupported finding` | `memory-aral-0.6b` | pending (distractor column) | 0.6B still writes Aral |
| token-cap whitespace | `degenerate output` | `degenerate-whitespace-1.7b` | — | documented, not prevented |
| absent-words flag is noisy | — | — | — | open |
| map unreadable at 40 nodes | n/a | n/a | n/a | open, UI phase |

## Log

### 2026-09-17 · night

- Phases 1 to 3 built and merged: `scripts/grade.js` (fourteen deterministic checks, pinned by `test/grade.test.js`), 24 micro-eval cases in `evals/visits.json` from the fixtures and the pocket-9 traces, page hooks (`newLive` with limits, `visit`, `pick`, Wikipedia record and replay with a no-network browser test), `scripts/lab.mjs` shared by both drivers, and `scripts/eval.mjs visits`.
- Wikipedia answers Node's bare fetch with HTTP 429; the rubric checker needed a User-Agent. The browser is unaffected.
- Rubrics checked against the live articles, and two candidate seeds changed on the evidence: Venice's subsidence section is one sentence with no cause in it, and "Venice sinking" searches to a song, so it is out; "sky blue" searches to the colour article, which has none of the physics, so that seed stays in as the search trap it is. Seven seeds in `evals/seeds.json`.
- First live micro-eval row, 0.6B on pocket-9: 8/24. Every section pick failed even with an enum grammar; the model never reads a section by name and never resolves when the excerpts already answer. The 1.7B, 4B and 8B suites are queued, then the benchmark matrix (four models, tangle and flat).
- 79 tests.

### 2026-09-17 · evening

- Agreed with John: measure before polishing. Wrote the plan: micro-evals on recorded visits, a benchmark with a flat baseline, Wikipedia record and replay.
- State inherited from the day: 63 tests, 20 experiments, prompt `tangle-pocket-9`, grammar `per-action-6`, all four models cached in the Chrome profile. 1.7B resolves a 40-node Dead Sea graph correctly; 8B finds the right section unaided and grounds its answer; 4B answers correctly from memory and cites a lead that does not contain the answer; 0.6B copies the prompt.
- Next: phase 1, graders and cases.
