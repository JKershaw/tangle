/**
 * Deterministic decomposition of an explicitly sequenced ask.
 *
 * The measured failure this exists for: given "fetch X, then use it to look up
 * Y", Qwen3-0.6B does the first hop and answers the second from recall — the
 * plan collapses to one step (`chain-json-then-wiki`, 3/20 before this
 * module). The model cannot hold a two-step plan, but it does not need to:
 * the user's own sentence *is* the plan, and code can walk it. Each step is
 * fed to the model as its own user turn, so the model only ever holds one
 * step and the transcript holds the rest — plan-and-execute with the user as
 * planner and the loop as scheduler.
 *
 * The same collapse happens on fan-out ("GET X and also GET Y",
 * `fanout-local-two-gets`, 0/20 unaided): one response in view reads as
 * "done" and the second errand is silently dropped. A conjunction whose next
 * word is unmistakably a new action splits the same way — fan-out run as a
 * chain, since parallel dispatch would only buy latency.
 *
 * Splitting is deliberately conservative, because every existing suite runs
 * through it:
 *
 * - Only an explicit sequencing "then" splits — `", then "`, `"; then "`,
 *   `". Then "`, `" and then "`. A bare mid-clause "then" never does.
 * - An "and" splits only when what follows opens with an action verb — an
 *   HTTP method in capitals, "fetch", "curl", "look up". Plain English "and"
 *   never does: "War and Peace" stays a title, "and get me a coffee" stays a
 *   clause (lowercase "get" is ambiguous, so it does not count).
 * - A marker that merely introduces the answer format — "then tell me what
 *   the server said" — is not a second hop, and splitting it would spend a
 *   generation on nothing: the step stays attached. (Three long-standing
 *   suite tasks at 100% phrase themselves exactly this way.)
 * - A "then" preceded by a conditional ("if the request fails, then…") is
 *   control flow, not sequencing: no split.
 * - Anything that produces more than three steps, or a fragment shorter than
 *   eight characters, abandons the split entirely.
