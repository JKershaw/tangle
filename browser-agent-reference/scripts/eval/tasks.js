/**
 * Task sets for the tool-call evaluation harness.
 *
 * Two suites, for two different questions.
 *
 * **local** is hermetic and answers "does the tool contract hold": the model is
 * handed a URL and has to reproduce it, vary the method, carry a body, and
 * refrain from calling the tool when told not to. Nothing here depends on the
 * model knowing anything about the world.
 *
 * **wiki** answers the question that actually matters — can it *find* something
 * — against real Wikipedia, which needs no proxy because the Wikimedia APIs
 * send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
 *
 * Each suite is split into `dev` and `holdout`. Iterate against dev; measure
 * against holdout only at checkpoints. A prompt tuned until the tasks in front
 * of it pass has been fitted to those tasks, and the holdout is the only thing
 * that will say so.
