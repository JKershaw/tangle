 * invented the telephone and pointed at the "Telephone" article, whose summary
 * never mentions Bell. The model fetched the right URL twenty times out of
 * twenty, answered from what it had actually read, and was scored 0% — a
 * finding about the harness reported as a finding about the model. Nothing in
 * the run said so, because a wrong answer and an unanswerable question look
 * identical from the outside.
 *
 * A task with an `oracleUrl` states where its answer is supposed to live. This
 * fetches that and checks the answer expectation matches the payload.
